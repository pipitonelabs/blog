Why I chose to run this Astro-based website in Kubernetes

As a developer who loves static site generators, I've been using Astro for building fast, content-focused websites. Astro's zero-JavaScript-by-default approach and excellent performance make it perfect for blogs. But when it came to deploying and managing this blog, I wanted something more robust than traditional hosting. That's why I decided to run it in Kubernetes.

## Why Kubernetes?

Kubernetes offers several advantages for deploying web applications, even static sites:

### Scalability
Even though this is a blog with relatively low traffic, Kubernetes allows me to scale effortlessly if needed. I can easily add more replicas or adjust resources based on demand.

### Containerization
By containerizing the Astro build, I ensure consistency across different environments. The same container that builds locally can run in production.

### CI/CD Integration
Kubernetes integrates seamlessly with modern CI/CD pipelines. I can automate deployments using tools like GitHub Actions, ensuring that every push to the main branch triggers a new build and deployment.

### Infrastructure as Code
Defining my deployment in YAML files means I can version control my infrastructure alongside my code. This makes it easy to reproduce environments and roll back if needed.

## The Setup

I use a simple Kubernetes deployment with:
- A Deployment for the Astro app
- A Service to expose it
- An Ingress for external access
- Optionally, a ConfigMap for environment variables

The Astro build process generates static files, which are served by a lightweight web server like Nginx inside the container.

## Challenges and Solutions

One challenge was optimizing the container size. Astro builds are typically small, but I made sure to use multi-stage Docker builds to keep the final image lean.

Another consideration was caching. Since this is a static site, I leverage Kubernetes' ability to handle static assets efficiently.

## Conclusion

Running an Astro blog in Kubernetes might be overkill for some, but for me, it provides the flexibility and control I need. It future-proofs the deployment and allows me to experiment with more complex setups if the blog grows.

If you're considering a similar setup, I'd recommend starting small and scaling up as needed. Kubernetes has a learning curve, but the benefits are worth it for serious projects.
